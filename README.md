# 🏗️ **BSDSPY** 🚧  
🎯 **BSDSPY** is a Python library for **Generating Design Spectra Curves** 📈 and obtaining **Site Factors** based on the inputted **S1** and **SS** values. It aligns with **DPWH standards**, ensuring precise seismic hazard calculations for Philippine structures.



## 🌟 Features 🌟  
✅ **Automated Design Spectra Generation** based on site-specific inputs.  
✅ **Seismic Site Factor Computation** for different soil conditions.  
✅ **Flexible Interpolation** for Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA).  
✅ **Expandable Framework** for additional seismic utilities.
